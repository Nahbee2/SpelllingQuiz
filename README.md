# SpelllingQuiz

This is a simple quiz application that tests the spelling skills of a user. It contains only two activities. The first activity takes in a users name and allows the user to press a button which links to the second activity. The second activity contains the actual quiz. A user can take the quiz and press the Grade Quiz button which presents the result as a toast message. A user can also press the Try Again button to start the quiz all over again.
